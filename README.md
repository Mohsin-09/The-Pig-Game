# 🎲 Pig Game  

A simple **Pig Dice Game** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Two players take turns rolling a dice. Each roll adds to their current score unless they roll a **1**, which resets their current turn score and passes the turn to the other player. Players can choose to **Hold** to add the current score to their total. The first player to reach the winning score (default 100) wins.
